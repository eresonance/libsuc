# libsuc - Simple utilities for C (that maybe suck)

Like most people I have a couple common header files that float around my projects. This is an attempt to standardize them and create a simple repo I can add to my projects.

* suc_macros.h - Common macros for concatenation, default arguments, etc.
* suc_range.h  - Range macros that look like the python range builtin.
* suc_ssa.h    - Simple static arrays that store metadata about the length/size of the array.
